## Description

Our app opens on the season summary page. On the right hand side you first see the list of drivers, besides which a list of their corresponding teams. Underneath the team is a slider with which you can adjust the number of races shown in the plots. On the right hand side is a column with all the races that happened in 2021, in order of which they took place. Adjusting the slider will highlight here what races are currently included in the selection.

The top plot is a map of the world displaying where races happened. Adjusting the aforementioned slider will add or remove corresponding races from the plot. Below the world map is a line plot that shows the cumulative progression of points per driver, or team. You can use the columns on the left to choose what drivers or teams you wish to include in this plot, and the slider for the number of races plotted.

If you click on a race in the right column, the app will take you to the race page. The columns on the far left or far right remain the same as the season page. In the middle there are now three new plots.  

- On the left is a circuit facts column, which shows the name and location of the race, the layout of the track, and race facts.  
- The top right is a table that displays the results of the race, qualifying session, and optionally the sprint. It will also show the fastest lap time of each section, with the overall fastest lap highlighted.  
- The bottom left is a line plot that shows the lap time per lap. Again, the left column can be used to select what drivers are displayed in this plot.
