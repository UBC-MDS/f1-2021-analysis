## The Motivation

The 2021 Formula 1 season was one of the most exciting in the history of the sport. A title fight in the drivers championship that left both the neutral viewer and fans of either Red Bull's Verstappen and Mercedes' Hamilton on the edge of their seat and beyond until the very last lap of the year in Abu Dhabi, and an equally as engaging brawl in the constructors midfield makes no one deny its legendary status.  

With all these developments throughout the season's calendar it can be hard to remember how it all went down. We are looking to provide a helping hand in reliving this awesome year, by summarising and visualising all the important statistics of 2021!

## The Description

![Landing Page](/www/sketch/dashboard_demo_tab_1.gif)

Our app opens on the Season Highlights page. On the left hand side you can either select Drivers or Teams: this selections determines what is shown in the cumulative season points plot to its right. Underneath the plot is a slider with which you can adjust the number of races shown in the plot. On the right hand side is a column with all the races that happened in 2021, in order of which they took place. Adjusting the slider will highlight here what races are currently included in the selection.

The second page is the Race Information tab. In the top left there is a dropdown selection box where you can select what race you'd like to have displayed. Underneath this is a picture of the track layout, together with a table containing facts about the corresponding Grand Prix. To its right is the results table: this shows the order the race finished in, but can also be sorted by starting position, fastest lap, and any other column displayed. In the top right is a search bar in order to filter the table by a search query. The fastest lap driven is highlighted purple in this table.
