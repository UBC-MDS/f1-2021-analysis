# Section 1: Motivation and Purpose
Our role: Data scientists in the sports industry
Target audience: Formula 1 Fans interested in analyzing the 2021 Season
The 2021 Season for Formula 1 World Championship was an intense season filled with suspense and plot twists. Unfortunately, the results of the race are displayed on the official website through a series of clunky tables that are difficult to navigate and can be difficult to make comparisons or do analysis with, not to mention the data itself is presented in very plain manner with minimal flexibility or engagement. As data scientists in the industry who seek to present this data in a more informative and interesting way, we propose building a data visualization app that allows users to easily find overall information for the season, filter for specific teams, drivers, or tracks while being to see how they compare with each other, and clearly and concisely present key summary statistics and information for each race/team/driver. The app will greatly enhance the ease at which information can be accessed in an interactive way, while still presenting comprehensive information for the whole season of interest.
